If you wish to contribute a function, please add a docstrin as a description of the function.
The docstring does not need to be in-depth, but should give a quick idea of what the function does.
The more complex the function, the bigger the docstring should naturally be.
If possible, try also to keep the return statement clean, so that it is somewhat easy to see what is returned.
Please keep this in mind when making pull-requests.
