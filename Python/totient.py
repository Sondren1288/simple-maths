def totient(num):
	"""
	Counts the numbers that are relative prime to the number.
	This means that if a number 'x' has common divisors with another number 'a' lower than itself,
	it is, 'a' is not relative prime to 'x'.
	This means that if a number is prime, its totient function is its value - 1, as 
	all numbers lower than the number itself is relative prime to the number.
	An example: totient(9):
				1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 are all relative prime
				3, 6, and 9 have at least one common divisor with 9
				returns 6, as there are 6 numbers relative prime to 9
		
	If you visit 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function'
	this function uses the function described under euler's product formula.
