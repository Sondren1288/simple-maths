"""
Amicable numbers are numbers where the sum of the diviors equals the other nummber,
where the divisors would be every number that divides a number n except n itself (includes 1).

An example of amicable numbers:
(220, 284) 
They are amicable because the divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; 
and the divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142, of which the sum is 220.
